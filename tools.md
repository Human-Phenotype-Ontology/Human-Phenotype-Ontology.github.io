# HPO Browser


The HPO Browser has a separate page for every term in the HPO. The following page, for instance, is for the root term: [http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org/hpoweb?id=HP:0000118](http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org/hpoweb?id=HP:0000118).

*PhenExplorer*: The PhenExplorer has been superceded by the new HPO browser, which has all the functionalities of 
PhenExplorer and has additional features such as Excel-Exports


## Clinical diagnostics using the HPO



### Phenomizer:

The Phenomizer is available at [http://compbio.charite.de/phenomizer](http://compbio.charite.de/phenomizer).

It is a web-based application for clinical diagnostics in human genetics using semantic similarity searches in ontologies [KÃ¶hler et al., AJHG, October 2009](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19800049). 
The Manual for the Phenomizer can be [found here](/data/phenomizermanual.pdf).
Note, that since the initial publication *The Phenomizer* has been update to the latest HPO ontology and annotation data. Of course, we also updated the p-values, meaning that the example from the 
publication (Table 1) is not exactly reproducible anymore. Sorry, for any inconvenience.

You may also try a new beta-prototype (Orphamizer) using a different algorithm and a different set of diseases and phenotype-associations. (See [http://compbio.charite.de/phenomizer_orphanet](http://compbio.charite.de/phenomizer_orphanet))

### Phenotype-driven interpretation of NGS results (Exome, Panel, or Whole-genome)

Please have a look at [PhenIX](http://compbio.charite.de/PhenIX/) and [Exomiser](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/exomiser/).


### Phenotype-driven interpretation of Copy-number variation

[PhenogramViz](http://charite.github.io/software-phenoviz.html) helps to visually explore gene-to-phenotype relations in CNVs. It also prioritzes 
pathogenic CNVs.
