### Ontology
In general, users should always use the PURL (persistent URL) to access the HPO-data, i.e.
 
 - [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo) 
 - [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.owl](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.owl) 
 
This currently re-directs you to our Hudson/Jenkins page. Hudson/Jenkins are continuous integration systems, that will provide stable releases.

### Annotations
The annotation files (e.g. phenotype_annotation.tab) from our 
[Hudson/Jenkins page](http://compbio.charite.de/hudson/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/). The format of the annotation file is explained under [Documentation](/documentation.html).

 - *phenotype_annotation.tab*: contains annotations from the HPO-team (mostly referring to OMIM), Orphanet, and DECIPHER
 - *phenotype_annotation_hpoteam.tab*: contains annotations the HPO-team (mostly referring to OMIM)
 - *negative_phenotype_annotation.tab*: contains negative annotations (i.e. a disease is NOT associated with this HPO-term)

### Database
The HPO can also be obtained in the form of a database. The most recent dump of this DB can be [obtained from here](http://compbio.charite.de/hudson/job/hpo.annotations.monthly/lastStableBuild/).
There are also some [Documentation-files](https://github.com/Human-Phenotype-Ontology/Human-Phenotype-Ontology.github.io/tree/master/data/db) available. If you have problems or questions related to the database version of the HPO, contact [Sebastian](http://drseb.github.io/). 


### Genes
Furthermore, [we provide two files](http://compbio.charite.de/hudson/job/hpo.annotations.monthly/lastStableBuild/) (*genes_to_phenotype.txt* and *phenotype_to_genes.txt*) to link between genes and HPO-terms.
These files will be updated at regular intervals (once every month). The links are generated using the information about the phenotypes of a particular syndrome and the corresponding genes that are known to cause this syndrome when mutated. Questions and further requests can be sent to [Sebastian](http://drseb.github.io/). 



### Spanish Translation of the HPO

[Pablo Lapunzina M.D., Ph.D.](http://www.ciberer.es/fichagrupos/grupo.aspx?unidad=U753), director of the Instituto de Genética Médica y Molecular (INGEMM) of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain, has coordinated the development of a Spanish translation of the HPO. The HPO team says: **¡Muchas gracias!** 

[We offer an Excel file](http://compbio.charite.de/tl_files/HPO/HPO-Spanish.xlsx) with the translation for download, and will be incorporating the data and future updates into a file that can be used with Protege.

### Mappings
The HPO team (Sandra, Peter, Sebastian) has developed a mapping between the categories of the London Dysmorphology Database (LDDB), which is an important 
resource used by many clinical geneticists to help in the differential diagnosis. The mapping is provided so that users will be able to convert phenotypic data encoded with LDDB categories into HPO terms.
We also have created mappings to MEDDRA, Orphanet, and UMLS. Please contact [Sebastian](http://drseb.github.io/) if you would like to obtain a copy.
