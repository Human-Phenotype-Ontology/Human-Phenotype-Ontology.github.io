## New format for the HPO annotation data

The HPO team is planning to modernize the format of the annotation file ("phenotype_annotation.tab"). Here is a link to documentation about the planned change.
http://hpo-annotation-qc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/annotationFormat.html
Comments/suggestions/criticisms would be very welcome. Please respond to this
GitHub issue: https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues/3393.

The legacy format will be maintained for several months or longer if requested by our users. The new format will have a few new fields and should not present major difficulties for those who will need to amend an HPO parser.

Thanks,
The HPO Team
