## HPO release - April 2016

We have just published a new HPO release for April 2016. This includes the [HPO ontology](http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo/1699/
). 

IMPORTANT: This does NOT include the associated annotations. Due to the recent change of the [OMIM license](http://omim.org/help/agreement), we do not (until further notice) make
our updates to the annotations available. We hope that the licensing discussions will soon be successful!

This new release comes again with a lot of changes: 

- Layperson synonyms (!)
- A lot new terms
- Fixes in logical definitions and hierarchy

Please have a look at the [list of closed issues](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+closed%3A%222016-01-13..2016-04-01%22) and [list of commits](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/compare/master@%7B2016-01-13%7D...master@%7B2016-04-01%7D) for more details.
