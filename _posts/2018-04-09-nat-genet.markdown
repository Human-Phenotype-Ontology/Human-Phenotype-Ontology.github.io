## Nature Genetics Paper on layperson vocabulary

In clinical settings, phenotypic abnormalities are often defined  using specialized medical terminology,  which can be  difficult  for  patients  to
   understand. This so-called terminology-gap can impede participation of patients and families in
   research projects concerned with the phenotype or natural history of diseases, and
   can even make it difficult for patients to understand data from their own medical charts.
   
The HPO Project and the Monarch Initiative have therefore "translated" the terms of the HPO into "plain language".
   For instance, the term for _Macrocephaly_ can be translated as _Large skull_.

This joint project with the Monarch-Initiative, HPO, PCORI, Sanford Medical, and a lot of other contributors on adding layperson synonyms to HPO has now been published in [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0096-x).
