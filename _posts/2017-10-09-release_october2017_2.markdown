## Update for October 2017 release

There was a mistake that caused all new annotations (since 2017) to be missing from the annotation file. 
If you downloaded the annotation between Oct. 5th and now (Oct 9th), you should consider downloading the files again. There is a lot new data missing.

Best,
Seb
