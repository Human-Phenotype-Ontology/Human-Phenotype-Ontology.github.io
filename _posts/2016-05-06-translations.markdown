## Translations of HPO into multiple languages

The guys at [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/hpo-translation) were so nice to give us a free account to host the translation project for HPO. We
aim at translating all labels, synonyms and textual definitions into several languages. If you like to help please make an account and apply
to join a language team. Of course, everybody who puts a significant amount of work will be part of possible publication. This is 
a great chance to improve HPO and increase the usability of this resource for patients and clinicians all over the world.

We already have a lot of content translated to spanish, italian and german (see [our github project](https://github.com/Human-Phenotype-Ontology/HPO-translations) ).

Please join this effort at [crowdin: HPO translation](https://crowdin.com/project/hpo-translation)!

Please [contact us](/contact.html) if you have any questions or seek for other ways to provide translations.
