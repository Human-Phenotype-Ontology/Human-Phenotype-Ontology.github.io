## March 2017 release

New release online. Note that we do no longer use jenkins for the HPO build (http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/) but have switched to GitHub releases.  You should anyway only use PURLs

 - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo
 - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.owl
 
For the annotation data, we will take similar steps in the near future.

If you like have a look at the [list of closed issues](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+closed%3A%222017-02-24..2017-03-09%22) and [list of commits](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/compare/master@%7B2017-02-24%7D...master@%7B2017-03-09%7D) for more details.

Best,
Your HPO team
