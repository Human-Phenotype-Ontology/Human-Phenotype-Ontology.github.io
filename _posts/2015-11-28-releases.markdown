## HPO releases

We are changing our policy with respect to HPO releases. This will affect both, the ontology data, as well as the annotation files. Previously, every edit that was made, resulted in a 'release'.

Now every edit is checked for consistency (using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology)), but we will only create a new release on our [Hudson/Jenkins server](http://compbio.charite.de/hudson) in larger, but regular, intervals. We aim at releases about once or twice a month.

Note, that all of this will change again in the near future, when we will be switching to [github-releases](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software). 

For all users that use the PURLs for accessing the ontology data this will not be a problem (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo and
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.owl).

Please contact me if you have any questions (dr.sebastian.koehler@gmail.com).
