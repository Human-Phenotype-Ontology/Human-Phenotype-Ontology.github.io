## Moved the HPO and its issue tracker

We have moved the HPO to Github. For users of HPO this is important if you want to file a ticket regarding an
improvement or bugfix in HPO. We previously had a sourceforge-tracker for this. This is now available on [Github](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues). You
might need to create a Github account in order to create a ticket.
