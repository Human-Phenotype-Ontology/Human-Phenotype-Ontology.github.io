## Genetics in Medicine article

Together with 

 * William Bone and William Gahl and others from [Undiagnosed Diseases Program](http://www.genome.gov/27544402), 
 * the [Monarch team](https://monarchinitiative.org/) and 
 * colleagues from the Centre for Computational Medicine Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto  
 
we published a new article in [Genetics in Medicine](http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/gim2015137a.html). We show that structured phenotyping of patients and computational analysis are effective 
adjuncts for diagnosing patients with genetic disorders.
