## How to obtain old HPO data

Several users were asking about old releases of the HPO data, e.g. the ontology or the annotation data.

I have now moved a lot of the old data to its own [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/Human-Phenotype-Ontology/HPO-archive).

Please [contact us](/contact.html) if you have any questions.

Best,
Sebastian
