## Nature Protocols Article

Together with Damian Smedley and Jules Jacobson from the Sanger Institute (UK), a group from Toronto (Canada), and members  of the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/)
we have published an article about Exomiser in [Nature Protocols](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v10/n12/full/nprot.2015.124.html). It is a software for phenotype-driven analysis of next-generation sequencing results that enables very efficient identification of disease relevant genomic variations.
