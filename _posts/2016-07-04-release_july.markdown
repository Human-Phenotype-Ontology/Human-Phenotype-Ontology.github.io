## HPO release - July 2016

We have just published a new HPO version for July 2016. This includes the [HPO ontology](http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo/1701/
). 

This new release comes again with a lot new terms and hierarchy fixes.


This still does NOT include the associated annotations due complicated license discussions, which will hopefully be successful soon.


Please have a look at the [list of closed issues](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+closed%3A%222016-04-02..2016-07-03%22) and [list of commits](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/compare/master@%7B2016-04-02%7D...master@%7B2016-07-03%7D) for more details.
